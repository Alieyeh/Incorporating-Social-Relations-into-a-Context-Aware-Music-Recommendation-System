This is a simple project we did for fun. It's writen in paper format but it isn't a published paper (it was just so we could gain some experience and learn).

ABSTRACT:

Social relations greatly influence users’ musical preferences, so they are beneficial to music recommendation tasks. In this paper, we propose a simple approach to include social relations in an existing context-aware music recommendation approach. We attempted to improve this music recommendation approach by limiting the global music set to those pieces which have some form of personal connection (direct or indirect) to the user therefore increasing the probability of successful recommendations. We do this by making use of users’ social relations graphs to find music pieces which the user might like or be curious about. Experimental evaluations on a real-world dataset show that the proposed approach outperforms baseline methods in terms of precision, and hitrate.
